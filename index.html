        <h3 class="post-title">I've landed a Tech interview!!!</h3>
        <div class="post-content">
          <p>Today I landed my <strong>FIRST</strong> <em>Tech interview</em>!</p>
          <p>
            I can't believe the first opportunity for me to get some expiernce has arisen, although I have only been doing this a little over a month I feel as if im ready to take on the world. However it has dawned on me that I have never taken a <em>Tech interview</em> or even know much about them, I did a little searching around as you do and have discovered that its not just an interview to discover your coding skills. I have learnt that it is also key to use your team skills like saying "we" instead of "I" if you are doing it infornt of the interviewer, it is also important to show how your brain is processing infomation so thinking aloud should be a priority. I will post another blog in the near future as to how it goes and what tips I can give you on smashing your tech interview.
          </p>
          <p>One last thing is that I got some good advice from this websites' post about Tech interviews. <br> <a href="https://learntocodewith.me/posts/technical-interview/">Click here</a> for more info.</p>

        <h3 class="post-title">Do you need a <Strong>degree</Strong> to be a web developer?</h3>
        <div class="post-content">
          <p>
            Today I have been exploring the best way to become a web developer, I have read so much on other peoples blogs, searched on reddit and I have come to the conclusion that no you don't need a degree to become a web developer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although you dont need a degree it is helpfull to have knowledge on coding, you will need knowldege on:
            <ul>
              <li>Html</li>
              <li>Css</li>
              <li>Javascript</li>
            </ul>
            It is essential to learn code to get a job in web development, you may also want to get yourself to a place where you can code a website like this to showcase your skills. although these code languages are the very basic standard you can learn even more languages like C# (Pronounced <em>C Sharp</em>). You may find it difficult to get a job without proof of skills and without relivent experience.
          </p>
          <p>To get relivent experience you may want to:
            <ul>
              <li>Find an internship</li>
              <li>Use your skills to develope websites <strong>FREELANCE</strong> </li>
              <li>Offering to help companies in exchange for resume recomendations</li>
            </ul>
            It's also good to keep in mind that places you get an internship or offer help may land you a job with that company afterwards, also if youve been doing freelance work you may want to stick with that, if its going well for you.

        <h3 class="post-title">Becoming a web developer #NoDegreeNeeded!</h3>
        <div class="post-content">
          <p>If somone told me one month ago I would be having a complete change of career and be able to code this website, I would have laughed! <strong>however this was not the case...</strong></p>
          <p>So about a month ago one of my friends told me that they had become a web developer and they did it with no degree,
            this was music to my ears. I had just had a back injury that has changed my life for ever, and although I can still walk and run ore even do exercise, I would no longer be able to work on a building site. It was my dream to do active work day in and day out so what was I suposed to do I had worked or been in college training to become a builder but no more.
          </p>
          <p>After speaking with my friend I took it upon myself to find out what it was like to be a <em>fullstack developer</em> . this was the first step to being able to do what I can do today, I found an app called <a href="https://getmimo.com">Mimo</a> and it taught me almost everything I need to know, my coding had got to a point where I could code a website like this. my next step is to find somone willing to take me on.</p>
